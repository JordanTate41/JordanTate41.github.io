  <h1>The Dictatorship of Roger Goodell</h1>

  <p>Roger Goodell was appointed the Commissioner of the NFL on August 8th, 2006 after succeeding former commissioner Paul Tagliabue. Since then, the NFL has experienced significant rule changes and suspensions in order to "Protect the Shield" of the NFL and the integrity of the game of football.</p>

  <p>Since taking over as commissioner, Roger Goodell has approved some of the most major and controversial rule changes in NFL history. At such a crucial time in the NFL's future, the 55-year-old Commissioner is conflicted between protecting NFL players and keeping the game exciting and popular. After numerous lawsuits and an increased public awareness of concussions, many of Goodell's rule changes surround the safety of NFL players.</p>
